### üìå Sample Queries & Business Insights

<details>
<summary><strong>üõçÔ∏è 1. Total Products per Brand</strong></summary>

```sql
SELECT b.brand_id, b.brand_name, COUNT(p.product_name) AS count
FROM brands AS b
JOIN products p ON p.brand_id = b.brand_id
GROUP BY b.brand_id, b.brand_name
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

**Insight:** Helps the product team identify which brands have the widest assortment.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üè∑Ô∏è 2. Label Products by Price Range</strong></summary>

```sql
SELECT product_id, product_name, list_price,
CASE
    WHEN list_price < 800 THEN 'Cheap'
    WHEN list_price BETWEEN 800 AND 1600 THEN 'Moderate'
    ELSE 'Expensive'
END AS price_range
FROM products;
```

**Insight:** Useful for marketing segmentation and discount strategies.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üì¶ 3. Find Unsold Products</strong></summary>

```sql
SELECT product_id, product_name
FROM products
WHERE product_id NOT IN (
    SELECT product_id
    FROM order_items
);
```

**Insight:** Helps inventory team identify stagnant stock.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üè™ 4. Total Sales per Store (Using CTE)</strong></summary>

```sql
WITH sales AS (
    SELECT s.store_id, s.store_name, oi.order_id, oi.list_price, oi.quantity, oi.discount
    FROM orders o
    JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
    JOIN stores s ON o.store_id = s.store_id
)
SELECT store_name, SUM(quantity * list_price * (1 - discount)) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY store_name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

**Insight:** Helps regional managers track which store is performing best in revenue.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üìÖ 5. Orders by Year (Timestamp Extraction)</strong></summary>

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS order_year, COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY order_year
ORDER BY order_year;
```

**Insight:** Identifies order volume trends across years.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üèÜ 6. Top 3 Expensive Products per Category (Window Function)</strong></summary>

```sql
WITH ranked_products AS (
	SELECT c.category_name, p.product_id, p.product_name, p.list_price,
	RANK () OVER (
		PARTITION BY p.category_id
		ORDER BY p.list_price DESC
	) AS price_rank
	FROM products AS p
	JOIN categories AS c ON p.category_id = c.category_id
)
SELECT product_name, category_name, list_price, price_rank
FROM ranked_products
WHERE price_rank <= 3;
```

**Insight:** Useful for merchandising top-tier products in each category.
